The guest can use these registers to exchange device-specific information with CrosVM. All these virtual registers from all PCI devices locate in a contiguous memory region. The base address of this memory region is provided by an IntObj named VCFG in the ACPI DSDT. The offset of each register is calculated in the same way as PCIe ECAM; i.e. offset = (bus << 20) | (device << 15) | (function << 12) | (register_index << 2)"]]});
